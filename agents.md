# Agents.md — Guidance for AI-assisted Development
_An overview of the current repository and its related projects, generated by [AgentPrimer](https://github.com/deanthecoder/AgentPrimer)._
## Summary for Agents
Use this overview as factual context when generating or editing code.  
Avoid unnecessary token use; prefer referencing this document instead of re-parsing source files.
## Agent Instructions (Overview)
- Read this report top-to-bottom to understand the repository structure, technologies, and conventions.
- Look for **Agent note** callouts embedded in specific sections; they contain targeted guidance.
- Keep context usage lean: prefer summaries and interfaces over ingesting full source files.
- Match the English style as reported below.
- Prefer existing frameworks, tests, and naming conventions shown here.
- Check Supported UI Languages when adding UI strings so required translations stay in sync.
## Repositories (3)
> **Agent note:** Sub-modules and sibling repositories often expose reusable libraries (e.g., extension methods, utilities). Cross-reference these before re-implementing.

    SEGA Master System emulator written in C#.
  - https://github.com/deanthecoder/DTC.Core (Submodule)  
    Core C# library (used by many deanthecoder repos)
  - https://github.com/deanthecoder/DTC.Installer (Submodule)  
    Cross platform script for packaging applications.
